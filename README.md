The data exploration, cleaning, removing any redundancies are done using SQL, Excel and Tableau.
To pull data from different tables into one, we'll first work on SQL. SQL will be used to gather the data and analyze the data.

  Data gathering is performed so that we can proceed to the next step in Excel.
  
  After importing the SQL file, we look for any redundancies, missing values and unwanted field in the dataset. After the data is cleaned and if everything is alright, we're ready to go to 
  the next step where the visuals are created using Tableau.
